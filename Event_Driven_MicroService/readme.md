Event-Driven Microservice

A Node.js microservice designed to process large streams of event data in real time. The service listens to an event stream, processes incoming events asynchronously, and stores the results in a MongoDB database. It includes concurrency control, rate limiting, error handling, and retry mechanisms.


Features

Event Listener: Subscribes to an event stream (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).
Data Processing: Handles event transformations, schema validation, and metric calculations.
Database Integration: Stores processed data in a MongoDB database for querying and filtering.
Concurrency and Rate Limiting: Utilizes Redis for managing burst traffic and limiting event rates.
Retry Mechanism: Implements exponential backoff for failed processes.

REST API:
GET /api/events: Retrieve recent processed events with pagination.
POST /api/process: Manually submit data for processing.
GET /api/metrics: Fetch summary metrics on processed data.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later)
MongoDB (running locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Redis (running locally or via a cloud service like Redis Cloud)
RabbitMQ or Kafka (for event streaming, optional for simulation)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd event-microservice
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file for environment variables:

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Example .env file:

env
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/event_service
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
Start MongoDB and Redis services.

Usage
Run the Application
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Or in development mode with auto-reload:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Simulate Events
To simulate incoming events:

Use RabbitMQ: Publish messages to the event-stream queue.
Use Kafka: Produce messages to the configured topic.
Alternatively, use the POST /api/process endpoint to manually send events.
Test the Application
Run unit and integration tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test

Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description

GET	/api/events	Fetch recent processed events (supports pagination).
POST	/api/process	Submit data for processing manually.
GET	/api/metrics	Retrieve metrics on processed event data.

Architecture
Event Listener: Listens for events using RabbitMQ or Kafka.
Processing Pipeline:
Validates event schemas.
Transforms event data (e.g., formatting, aggregation).
Handles errors and retries failed events.

Database:
MongoDB stores processed events.
Optimized schema for querying and filtering.

Concurrency Management:
Redis tracks event rates and enforces limits.

REST API:
Exposes endpoints for event data and metrics.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side runtime.
Express: REST API framework.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing event data.
Redis: In-memory database for concurrency and rate limiting.
amqplib: RabbitMQ client for event streaming.
Jest: Testing framework.

Future Improvements
Add authentication and authorization to API endpoints.
Implement dynamic scaling with Docker and Kubernetes.
Enhance monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
Extend support for multiple event streams (e.g., Kafka, WebSocket).
